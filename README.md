# AWS and the Future of AI in Cloud Computing

[AWS re:Invent 2025: Amazon announces Nova 2 and AI innovations](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-re-invent-2025-ai-news-updates)

I found this article interesting because it shows how AWS is pushing the boundaries of what cloud computing can do with AI. At re:Invent 2025, AWS announced frontier agents like Kiro (an autonomous coding agent), AWS Security Agent, and AWS DevOps Agent that can work independently for extended periods. They also introduced Graviton5, their most powerful CPU yet, and expanded the Amazon Nova model family.

What excites me most is how these tools are changing software development. Instead of just providing infrastructure, AWS is now offering AI-powered agents that can act as virtual team members for development, security, and operations. This shift from passive cloud services to active AI assistants could fundamentally change how we build and deploy software.

I found the "open training" with Nova Forge concept very interesting because it allows the users to provide proprietary data to blend with the Amazon datasets to train a specialized model just for that specific user. This seems like a good solution compared to finetuning when the user needs more control of the model or needs it to perform more specialized tasks.
